Purpose
---------
The overall goal of this project is to learn the basics of C# and MVC 4. The pupose of this specific project is to create a web app which can be used on multiple devices (web, phone, tablet, etc) that will list restaurants in your area and give you a suggestion on where to eat.

Requirements
-------------
* Use a public API to gather businesses/restaurants in your area.
* Create a rating systems on each restaurant and store the results in a database.
* Use the latest technology to create a leaner and more readable codebase, such as jQuery and HTML5.
* Create or use an existing framework for a responsive layout. 
* Include the Google Maps API to pin places on a map and provide directions to the selected restaurant.
 
Roadmap
--------
Each section will be broken up into a week.

### Week 1 ###
* Research various responsive frameworks and choose the best option that fits, or create your own.
* Create a layout for the website.
 
### Week 2 ###
* Research the API you will use for gathering business data. (CityGrid is a good option)
* Start writing examples queries to gather the best data you can using Latitude/Longitude, zip code, city and state, and address. The input will be the users choice, so it's best to use as many options as possible.

### Week 3 ###
* Create a function to find the users geolocation and provide other ways for the user to give you their location.
* Start researching the Google Maps API.
 
### Week 4 ###
* Combine all of the previous functions and queries you've created and implement them into the website.
* List the results by business name and distance. 
* Provide the category of each restaurant if possible.
* Provide a link to directions on how to get to the restaurant.
